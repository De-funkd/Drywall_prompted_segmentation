# Reason: Raw and processed datasets are excluded from version control
# to maintain repository size and respect licensing terms. These can be
# reproduced using the documented data preparation scripts.

# Reason: Pretrained model weights are downloaded automatically from
# HuggingFace Hub at runtime and are not redistributed with this repository
# to respect licensing terms and reduce repository size.
